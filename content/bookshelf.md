The following is my current reading bookshelf as well as my future bookshelf. I think reading is one of the most valuable skill, an entrepreneur, or evene a normal individual can have.
In the future you can expect highly detailed book reviews. But currently my time does not allow this.

This is my **current** bookshelf:

- **Bhagavad-Gita**
- **Steve Jobs** by Walter Isaacson
- **The Almanack of Naval Ravikant** by Eric Jorgenson

- **Zero to One** by Peter Thiel
- **Zero to Sold** by Arvid Kahl
- **Read Write Own** by Chris Dixon, a16z
- **The Nvidia Way** by Kim Tae
- **Quantitative Trading** by Ernie Chan
- **Quantitative Finance for Dummies** by Steve Bell

And this is my **future** bookshelf:
