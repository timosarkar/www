I have been watching the ai industry closely for quite some time. I love to play and build cool things with new tech. Mid-this year (2024), I came across a thing called **agentic ai**. In this post I want to explain and use this new technology which is fundamentally a game-changer for all big industries.

I am pretty sure that at the time of writing this post you have seen, used, or maybe even already built your LLM (large-language model). The LLMs like **ChatGPT**, **Anthropic Claude** or **Google Gemini** are omni-prevalent. Infact, those LLMs have revolutionized the current perception of the capabilities of ai. But as you may know, LLMs are only capable to process text inputs (normally... sometimes also multi-modal i/o) and then output other text based on the input and decision-making. They are just able to perform text-based actions. However, they can't really do things for you like searching the web or writing cumbersome excelsheets for you. *This is where agentic ai comes in place...*
