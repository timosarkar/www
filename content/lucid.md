Recently I have re-watched the award winning scifi movie Inception that has been
directed by Christopher Nolan. The movie plot as well as the tech they have used were
really fascinating. The idea of constructing and controlling a persons subconscious mind
did really struck with me. I genuinely had to do some research on this, as I was
hyped up.

I then came around with the proven concept of Lucid Dreaming. So Lucid Dreaming is
a state that can take place when you are aware that you are dreaming. Resulting you can force
your subconscious mind to alter the dream arbitrarily to any of your likings. For example
lucid dreamers can study during their dreams or solve complex riddles.

## Digging into the rabbit hole

After some refined and more in-depth research, I found a company called PropheticAI that
essentially builds a headset that can induce coherent and vivid lucid dreams at any moment.
They do this using novel ultrasound technology. Apparently they have even an own AI model
called MORPHEUS-1, that can classify REM sleep/dreaming phase based on live EEG and fMRI data.
However, that is not all. Prophetic plans to allow the dreamer to induce custom lucid dreams with a
predefined environment. How sick is this?!

## Lucid Dreaming Tech

To actually get into a lucid dreaming state, I have found and put together this list of techniques.

- MILD (Mnemonic Induced Lucid Dreams): Get Lucid Dreams by just constantly telling your mind to. 
Much like the law-of-attraction.
- WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dreams): Basically getting faster into REM-sleep by interrupting your sleep
for 15 - 30 minutes of wake time. Chances are higher to get a Lucid Dream in REM-sleep.
- TILD (Totem Induced Lucid Dreams): Method to initiate lucidity in a dream by performing a set of reality-checks
like spinning a spinning-top and checking if it topples after some time. Technically in the dream it should not.

## When things get wild...

There is even more cool stuff. For example, in the movie Inception, the lucif dreamers constructed a layered environment
with 3 or 4 layers of dreams within a dream. Even this is possible in real life. It is part of a method called DILD
(Dream Induced Lucid Dreams) where a lucid dreamer adds a false awakening that shifts into another dream.

Then there is lots of other crazy and cool stuff that you can do such as Astral Projection, Dream Teleportation, exploring Alien
worlds, studying for an upcoming exam and entering the Lucid Void / Limbus.

## I want to become a Dream Architect/Engineer

I think the neuroscience space and research of the human subconscious mind opens us so many new doors and ways
on how we can extend the horizon from whats known. In my opinion, an utopian future, where we can seamlessly control
and construct our dreams to our own likings, sounds so cool. Imagine just working during sleep. Technically the body
still is in REM-sleep and the subconscious mind emulates the dream, so that means that still while working in the dream,
the body relaxes itself. So it would be technically effortless working.

I mean just think about it. We are spending around 33% of the day/year sleeping. Imagine an economy where we could optimize
and construct our dreams to pick up work. This could boost the yearly US GDP of $100 trillion to nearly ~$133 trillion dollar
per year with nearly any effort.

The option of investing into this space and learn more to become a "Dream Architect/Engineer" sounds extremely compelling to me
and is definitely something that I will watch precisely in the upcoming years. I will definitely continue my research on this.
