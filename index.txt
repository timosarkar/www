How to Read this Blog
---------------------
This blog is made up of a collection of text files, hence no clickable links.
It's also best read at 110% zoom. All links are in the format [Link Title](url).
If the url is relative, paste it after the root domain to go the right page. If
it is absolute, replace the entire URL. You can use `ctrl + l` or `cmd + l` to
edit the address bar.

All posts are summarised here with tags. Search for the tags with the browser
find function, eg: #best to find the best posts. If you want to know why I'm
doing this read [only text](/only.txt).

  In this blog we will dive into podman and get to know some common commands
* 15-10-2024 [Only Text](/only.txt)
  #best, #blog, #plain_text
  I go deep why this blog is written in plain text, what I'm planning to do with
  it, and a spec for how this blog is structured.
