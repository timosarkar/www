<h1>Hello world once again!</h1>
<p>Hello world once again from my new blog. I recall rebuilding my blog for atleast 20 times the last few years. This time I use the <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo static-site generator</a> to build my HTML page.
As usually, I write content in form of Markdown which is a simple and very lightweight markup language that allows you to write content in plaintext instead of cluttered HTML.</p>
<p>The stylesheet of this blog is stripped down to the bare minimum and will most likely fit easily into your businesscard. The raison-d&rsquo;etre is my obsession with <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com/">brutalist- and minimalist webdesign</a>. I think that when you want your target audience to really focus on your content, then you should make your site as accessible and easy to read as possible. That beeing said, this site does not use any sort of <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>external fonts</em>, <em>external css</em> or use any type of <em>heavy HTML</em>. Also this site does not collect any data nor cookies from you.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://vercel.io">vercel</a> as my CI/CD (continuos integration / continuous delivery) platform which is cloud-based and allows me to initiate deployment processes for this site from anywhere and at anytime for free.</p>
<p>Currently, I use the <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix package-manager</a> to manage my local builds so I can always trust on my nix-shell to use the pre-defined version of Hugo and not break my current infra.</p>
