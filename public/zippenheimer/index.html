<p>During some of my doom scrolling on youtube, I have found a guy flexing his new <strong>1 trillion zettabyte</strong> zipbomb. First, I was blown away how he managed to fit 1 trillion zettabytes of data into a 122 kilobytes sized zipfile. He states, that he used a recursive nested approach where you start with lets say, 1 gigabyte of base data which you then compress into a zipfile with a very high compression ratio (likely &gt;95%). Then you create n amount of layers where each layer contains an n amount of recursively zipped base data. Since you compress the files using a very high compression ratio, you can fit <strong>a lot of data</strong> into a zipfile. <strong>And I mean really a lot!</strong></p>
<p><img src="/bomb.jpg" alt="bomb"></p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the term &ldquo;zettabyte&rdquo;, you can find here a table of unit conversions:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1 megabyte = 1024 bytes
1 gigabyte = 1024 megabytes
1 terabyte = 1024 gigabytes
1 petabyte = 1024 terabytes
1 exabyte = 1024 petabytes
1 zettabyte = 1024 exabytes
1 yottabyte = 1024 zettabytes
1 ronnabyte = 1024 yottabytes
1 quetta/brontobyte = 1024 ronnabytes
1 geopbyte = 1024 quetta/brontobytes
1 saganbyte = 1024 geopbytes
</code></pre><p>All units until yottabytes are officially standardized. The others are possible, but widely used/seen candidates for standardization. <strong>For reference:</strong> yearly internet traffic is estimated at <strong>3.3 zettabytes</strong>.</p>

<p>You might ask yourself, why people waste their time to create zipfiles with astronomically large expansion sizes? Well, nowadays these files wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily pose a threat. But if you are using a <strong>ZIP Extractor</strong> which recursively extract nested zipfiles, this is a threat for you. Since an extractor must handle huge expansion sizes that exponentially grow at each level/depth, the extractor will eventually crash and cause your computer os to freeze. I am also pretty sure, that Windows 7 and XP have recursive extraction builtin. If not you might test using <strong>ExtractNow</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="record-holders">Record Holders</h2>
<p>On 13th of November 2020 somebody made a zipbomb that expands to <strong>55.4 yottabyte</strong>. Recently (13th of May 2024) an user named <strong>NIMDAFreaky</strong> published a zipbomb on discord, sized at <strong>1,148 saganbytes</strong>. However, two weeks ago somebody nicknamed, <strong>TheCanadianKid</strong> created a zipbomb with <strong>41,400,223,250 saganbytes</strong>. His compressed file was sized roughly <strong>7 gigabytes</strong>.</p>
<p>Damn. This must be the largest ever created. Right? I do not think so. <strong>I might be able to create a much larger one&hellip;</strong></p>
<h2 id="creating-my-own">Creating my own</h2>
<p>I quickly wrote a <strong>golang</strong> program. The program is called tsarbomba and was recently open-sourced on <a href="https://github.com/timosarkar/tsarbomba">GitHub</a>. The program creates a <strong>1 megabyte needle file</strong> which is intended as the base file. The file is filled with repetitive &ldquo;0&quot;s. The needle file is then compressed into an archive called <strong>level1.zip</strong>. The compression-ratio for the first levels are always at roughly 99.99%. So therefore, the archive would shrink from 1 megabyte to 1 kilobyte. The program then enters an iterative loop for which in every iteration, it will create a new archive with 10 copies of the previous archive. So <strong>level2.zip</strong> would contain 10 level1.zip files. You can see, that the real size will unproportionally stay relative to the decompressed expansion size which grows exponentially to astronomic values.</p>
<p>I have also added thread-safe <strong>goroutines</strong> and <strong>channels</strong> to speed the programs runtime up by some orders of magnitude. Then I did a test run with 70 layers where each layer contains 10 archives of the previous level. After roughly 90 seconds, I was left with a <strong>21 gigabyte</strong> large zipbomb (real compressed filesystem size). The decompressed expansion size was around <strong>10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 saganbytes</strong>.</p>
<p>And this value is much larger than the previous record holder. <strong>I therefore claim my bomb to be the worlds largest zipbomb ever made. Muahahaha.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I have not uploaded the final zipbomb to github, as it has a hard-limit of 2 gigabytes. Even for git LFS. I am currently <strong>sharding</strong> the tsarbomba archive into 2 GB shards so I can upload it for verification.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="size-comparison">Size comparison</h2>
<p>For the final decompressed expansion size of tsarbomba: If every byte was a <strong>grain of sand</strong>. The total volume and size of the zipbomb would be <strong>100 times larger than the total volume of our milky-ways galaxy</strong>. Let that sink in!</p>
